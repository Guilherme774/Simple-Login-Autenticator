# Simple-Login-Autenticator
Just a simple login screen autenticator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I made this using an external API from reqres.in

The autenticator use simple security resources, with a simple regex email autenticator and a min characters on the password field.

This for study purpose only.

You can use it for free.
